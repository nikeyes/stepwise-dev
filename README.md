A modular development workflow suite for Claude Code inspired by [Ashley Ha's workflow](https://medium.com/@ashleyha/i-mastered-the-claude-code-workflow-145d25e502cf), adapted to work 100% locally with thoughts.

## 🎯 What This Is

Solves the context management problem: LLMs lose attention after 60% context usage.

Implements **Research → Plan → Implement → Validate** with frequent `/clear` and persistent `thoughts/` storage.

### Philosophy

- Keep context < 60% (attention threshold)
- Split work into phases
- Clear between phases, save to `thoughts/`
- Never lose research or decisions

## 📦 Available Plugins

This repository contains **3 independent plugins** that can be installed separately based on your needs:

### 1. **stepwise-core** (Core Workflow)
The foundation plugin with the complete Research → Plan → Implement → Validate cycle.

**Includes:**
- 5 slash commands (`research_codebase`, `create_plan`, `iterate_plan`, `implement_plan`, `validate_plan`)
- 5 specialized agents (codebase exploration and thoughts management)
- 1 thoughts-management skill (with 3 bash scripts)

[→ Read more](./core/README.md)

### 2. **stepwise-git** (Git Operations)
Clean git commit workflow without Claude attribution.

**Includes:**
- 1 slash command (`commit`)
- Smart staging and commit message generation

[→ Read more](./git/README.md)

### 3. **stepwise-web** (Web Research)
Web search and research capabilities for external context.

**Includes:**
- 1 specialized agent (`web-search-researcher`)
- Deep web research with source citations

[→ Read more](./web/README.md)

## 🚀 Installation

### Option 1: Install All Plugins (Recommended for first-time users)

```bash
# Add marketplace from GitHub
/plugin marketplace add nikeyes/stepwise-dev

# Install all three plugins
/plugin install stepwise-core@stepwise-dev
/plugin install stepwise-git@stepwise-dev
/plugin install stepwise-web@stepwise-dev
```

### Option 2: Install Only What You Need

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add nikeyes/stepwise-dev

# Install only the core workflow
/plugin install stepwise-core@stepwise-dev

# Optionally add git operations
/plugin install stepwise-git@stepwise-dev

# Optionally add web research
/plugin install stepwise-web@stepwise-dev
```

**Restart Claude Code after installation.**

## 📁 Directory Structure

After running `thoughts-init` (from stepwise-core) in a project:

```
<your-project>/
├── thoughts/
│   ├── nikey_es/          # Your personal notes (you write)
│   │   ├── tickets/       # Ticket documentation
│   │   └── notes/         # Personal notes
│   ├── shared/            # Team-shared documents (Claude writes)
│   │   ├── research/      # Research documents
│   │   ├── plans/         # Implementation plans
│   │   └── prs/           # PR descriptions
│   └── searchable/        # Hardlinks for grep (auto-generated)
│       ├── nikey_es/      # → hardlinks to nikey_es/
│       └── shared/        # → hardlinks to shared/
├── .gitignore            # (add thoughts/searchable/ to this)
└── ...
```

**Key distinction:**
- **`nikey_es/`**: Personal tickets/notes you create manually
- **`shared/`**: Formal docs Claude generates from commands

### Why Hardlinks?

- **Fast searching**: Grep one directory instead of many
- **No duplication**: Same file, same inode, no extra disk space
- **Auto-sync**: Changes in source are immediately visible
- **Efficient**: Better than symlinks for grep operations

## 🔄 The Four-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Research (stepwise-core)

```bash
/stepwise-core:research_codebase How does authentication work?
```

Spawns parallel agents, searches codebase and thoughts/, generates comprehensive research document.

### Phase 2: Plan (stepwise-core)

```bash
/stepwise-core:create_plan Add rate limiting to the API
```

Iterates with you 5+ times, creates detailed phases with verification steps.

### Phase 3: Implement (stepwise-core)

```bash
/stepwise-core:implement_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-rate-limiting.md
```

Executes one phase at a time, validates before proceeding.

### Phase 4: Validate (stepwise-core)

```bash
/stepwise-core:validate_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-rate-limiting.md
```

Systematically verifies the entire implementation.

### Commit (stepwise-git)

```bash
/stepwise-git:commit
```

Creates clean commits without Claude attribution.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Complete Feature Development

```bash
# Research (core)
/stepwise-core:research_codebase Where is user registration handled?
# /clear

# Plan (core)
/stepwise-core:create_plan Add OAuth login support
# /clear

# Implement (core)
/stepwise-core:implement_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/...md
# /clear

# Validate (core)
/stepwise-core:validate_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/...md

# Commit (git)
/stepwise-git:commit
```

### Example 2: Using Web Research

```bash
# Research external best practices (web)
"What are the best practices for implementing rate limiting in REST APIs?"
# The web-search-researcher agent will be invoked automatically

# Research your codebase (core)
/stepwise-core:research_codebase Where do we handle API rate limiting?

# Continue with plan and implementation...
```

## 🏷️ Version Management

```bash
# Check versions
/plugin list

# Update all plugins
/plugin update stepwise-core@stepwise-dev
/plugin update stepwise-git@stepwise-dev
/plugin update stepwise-web@stepwise-dev
```

## 📝 Context Management

**Golden Rule**: Never exceed 60% context capacity.

```bash
/context  # Check current usage
/clear    # Clear between phases
```

## 🔧 Customization

**Change Username**: Set `export THOUGHTS_USER=your_name` or edit the thoughts-init script.

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
make test          # Run all automated tests
make test-verbose  # Run tests with debug output
make check         # Run shellcheck on bash scripts
make ci            # Run full CI validation
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Plugin Issues

**Commands not showing**:
- Restart Claude Code
- Check plugins enabled: `/plugin list`
- Reinstall if needed

**Plugin installation fails**:
- Verify marketplace: `/plugin marketplace list`
- Check network connection

### Workflow Issues

**Hardlinks failing**: Auto-falls back to symlinks

**No files synced**: Run `THOUGHTS_DEBUG=1 thoughts-sync`
