# Claude Code Workflow - Local Setup

A complete workflow system for Claude Code inspired by [Ashley Ha's workflow](https://medium.com/@ashleybcha/i-mastered-the-claude-code-workflow-d7ea726b38fd), adapted to work 100% locally without HumanLayer Cloud dependencies.

## 🎯 What This Is

This workflow implements the **Research → Plan → Implement → Validate** cycle with:

- **6 Slash Commands** for structured development
- **5 Specialized Agents** for parallel research
- **3 Bash Scripts** for local thoughts/ management
- **Local-only operation** - no cloud dependencies

### Philosophy

Never exceed 60% context. Split work into phases. Clear context between each. Save everything to a local `thoughts/` directory with hardlinks for efficient searching.

## 📦 What's Included

### Slash Commands (`.claude/commands/`)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/research_codebase` | Research and document codebase comprehensively |
| `/create_plan` | Create detailed implementation plans iteratively |
| `/iterate_plan` | Update existing implementation plans |
| `/implement_plan` | Execute plans phase by phase with validation |
| `/validate_plan` | Validate implementation against plan |
| `/commit` | Create git commits (no Claude attribution) |

### Specialized Agents (`.claude/agents/`)

| Agent | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `codebase-locator` | Find WHERE code lives in the codebase |
| `codebase-analyzer` | Understand HOW code works |
| `codebase-pattern-finder` | Find similar patterns to model after |
| `thoughts-locator` | Discover documents in thoughts/ |
| `thoughts-analyzer` | Extract insights from thoughts docs |

### Thoughts Scripts (`~/.local/bin/`)

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `thoughts-init` | Initialize thoughts/ structure in a project |
| `thoughts-sync` | Sync hardlinks in searchable/ directory |
| `thoughts-metadata` | Generate git metadata for documents |

## 🚀 Installation

### Quick Install

```bash
./install.sh
```

This will:
- Install commands to `~/.claude/commands/`
- Install agents to `~/.claude/agents/`
- Install scripts to `~/.local/bin/`
- Create backups of any existing files
- Make all scripts executable

### Verify Installation

```bash
# Check scripts are in PATH
which thoughts-init thoughts-sync thoughts-metadata

# Should return paths like:
# /Users/you/.local/bin/thoughts-init
# /Users/you/.local/bin/thoughts-sync
# /Users/you/.local/bin/thoughts-metadata
```

If not found, add to your shell config (`~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc`):

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

## 📁 Directory Structure

After running `thoughts-init` in a project:

```
<your-project>/
├── thoughts/
│   ├── nikey_es/          # Your personal notes
│   │   ├── tickets/       # Ticket documentation
│   │   └── notes/         # Personal notes
│   ├── shared/            # Team-shared documents
│   │   ├── research/      # Research documents
│   │   ├── plans/         # Implementation plans
│   │   └── prs/           # PR descriptions
│   └── searchable/        # Hardlinks for grep (auto-generated)
│       ├── nikey_es/      # -> hardlinks to nikey_es/
│       └── shared/        # -> hardlinks to shared/
├── .gitignore            # (add thoughts/searchable/ to this)
└── ...
```

### Why Hardlinks?

- **Fast searching**: Grep one directory instead of many
- **No duplication**: Same file, same inode, no extra disk space
- **Auto-sync**: Changes in source are immediately visible
- **Efficient**: Better than symlinks for grep operations

## 🔄 The Four-Phase Workflow

### Phase 1: Research

**Goal**: Understand what exists before changing anything.

```bash
# In Claude Code
/research_codebase How does authentication work in this app?
```

This will:
1. Spawn parallel agents to search the codebase
2. Search thoughts/ for historical context
3. Generate a comprehensive research document
4. Save to `thoughts/shared/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`
5. Run `thoughts-sync` to update searchable/

**Output**: Research document with code references, architecture insights, and file:line numbers.

### Phase 2: Plan

**Goal**: Create a detailed, iterative implementation plan.

```bash
# In Claude Code
/create_plan Add rate limiting to the API
# Or reference a research doc:
/create_plan @thoughts/shared/research/2025-11-09-auth-system.md
```

This will:
1. Ask clarifying questions
2. Research existing patterns in the codebase
3. Iterate with you 5+ times on the plan
4. Create phases with specific changes
5. Define automated AND manual success criteria
6. Save to `thoughts/shared/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`

**Output**: Detailed plan with phases, file paths, code snippets, and verification steps.

### Phase 3: Implement

**Goal**: Execute one phase at a time with confidence.

```bash
# In Claude Code
/implement_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-rate-limiting.md
```

This will:
1. Read the complete plan
2. Implement Phase 1
3. Run automated verification (tests, linting)
4. **Pause for manual verification**
5. Wait for your confirmation
6. Proceed to Phase 2 (or stop)

**Key Rule**: One phase at a time. Validate before proceeding.

### Phase 4: Validate

**Goal**: Systematically verify the entire implementation.

```bash
# In Claude Code
/validate_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-rate-limiting.md
```

This will:
1. Check all phases are complete
2. Run all automated verification
3. Review code against plan
4. Identify deviations or issues
5. Generate validation report

**Output**: Report showing what passed, what needs fixing, and manual test checklist.

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development

```bash
# 1. Research
/research_codebase Where is user registration handled?
# → Saves to thoughts/shared/research/2025-11-09-user-registration.md
# → /context shows 45%
# → /clear

# 2. Plan
/create_plan Add OAuth login support
# → Iterates 5 times
# → Saves to thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-oauth-login.md
# → /context shows 58%
# → /clear

# 3. Implement (Phase 1 only)
/implement_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-oauth-login.md
# → Completes Phase 1
# → Runs tests
# → Pauses for manual testing
# → You verify it works
# → "Continue to Phase 2"
# → /context shows 62%
# → /clear

# 4. Validate
/validate_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-oauth-login.md
# → Comprehensive verification
# → /context shows 41%

# 5. Commit
/commit
# → Creates atomic commits
```

### Example 2: Bug Investigation

```bash
# Research the bug
/research_codebase Why are webhooks timing out after 30 seconds?

# Create a fix plan
/create_plan Fix webhook timeout issue based on @thoughts/shared/research/...md

# Implement the fix
/implement_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/...md

# Commit
/commit
```

### Example 3: Iterating on a Plan

```bash
# You've created a plan but need to adjust it
/iterate_plan @thoughts/shared/plans/2025-11-09-feature.md

# Claude asks: What changes would you like to make?
# You: "Add error handling phase before deployment"

# Claude updates the plan in place
```

## 🛠️ Thoughts Scripts

### thoughts-init

Initialize thoughts/ in current project:

```bash
cd ~/projects/my-app
thoughts-init
```

Creates structure, README, .gitignore, and runs initial sync.

### thoughts-sync

Sync hardlinks in searchable/:

```bash
thoughts-sync
```

Run this:
- After adding new .md files
- After modifying file structure
- If searchable/ seems out of sync

The scripts automatically run this after `/research_codebase` and `/create_plan`.

### thoughts-metadata

Generate metadata for the current repo:

```bash
thoughts-metadata
```

Returns:
```
Current Date/Time (TZ): 2025-11-09 15:30:00 PST
ISO DateTime: 2025-11-09T23:30:00+0000
Date Short: 2025-11-09
Current Git Commit Hash: abc123...
Current Branch Name: main
Repository Name: my-app
Git User: nikey_es
```

Used internally by commands to populate frontmatter.

## 📝 Context Management

**Golden Rule**: Never exceed 60% context capacity.

Check context frequently:
```bash
/context
```

Clear between phases:
```bash
/clear
```

### The 60% Rule

| Phase | Typical Context | Action |
|-------|----------------|--------|
| Research | 50-70% | Clear after |
| Plan | 50-65% | Clear after |
| Implement | 60-75% | Clear between phases |
| Validate | 40-50% | Usually safe to continue |

## 🎓 Best Practices

### 1. Always Research First

Even if you "know" the codebase, run research. You'll discover:
- Patterns you forgot
- Edge cases
- Related code
- Historical decisions

### 2. Iterate the Plan 5+ Times

First draft is never complete. Ask:
- Are phases properly scoped?
- Are success criteria specific?
- Missing edge cases?
- Can automated tests verify this?

### 3. One Phase at a Time

**Don't skip phases!** If Phase 1 has bugs, Phase 2 will inherit them.

### 4. Separate Automated vs Manual

Always split success criteria:

```markdown
### Success Criteria:

#### Automated Verification:
- [ ] Tests pass: `make test`
- [ ] Linting clean: `make lint`

#### Manual Verification:
- [ ] UI looks correct on mobile
- [ ] Performance is acceptable
```

### 5. Sync Regularly

After creating research or plans:
```bash
thoughts-sync
```

This makes them searchable for future sessions.

## 🔧 Customization

### Change Username

Default is `nikey_es`. To change:

1. Edit in `thoughts-init`:
   ```bash
   # Line 8
   USERNAME="${THOUGHTS_USER:-your_name}"
   ```

2. Or set environment variable:
   ```bash
   export THOUGHTS_USER=your_name
   ```

### Add More Commands

Create new `.md` files in `~/.claude/commands/`:

```markdown
---
description: Your custom command
---

# My Custom Command

Instructions for Claude...
```

Claude will auto-detect them on next start.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Commands not showing up

```bash
# Check if files exist
ls ~/.claude/commands/

# Restart Claude Code
```

### Scripts not in PATH

```bash
# Check PATH
echo $PATH | grep -q ".local/bin" && echo "OK" || echo "Add to PATH"

# Add to shell config
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

### Hardlinks failing (cross-filesystem)

If you see warnings about hardlinks failing:

```bash
# The script falls back to symlinks automatically
# This happens when thoughts/ is on a different filesystem
# It's fine - symlinks work just slower for grep
```

### thoughts-sync shows 0 files

```bash
# Check if thoughts/ has .md files
find thoughts -name "*.md" -type f

# Re-run sync with debug
THOUGHTS_DEBUG=1 thoughts-sync
```
