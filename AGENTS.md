# AGENTS.md

This file is the source of truth for coding agents working in this repository.
`CLAUDE.md` is a one-line pointer to it, so Claude Code and OpenAI Codex read the same guidance.

## Repository Overview

This is a **workflow tooling project for Claude Code itself**, not a traditional software application. It provides skills, specialized agents, and bash scripts that implement a structured Research → Plan → Implement → Validate development cycle.

The workflow operates entirely locally without cloud dependencies and uses a `thoughts/` directory system for persistent storage.

## Multi-Plugin Architecture

This project is distributed as **6 independent Claude Code plugins** in a single marketplace:

### Plugin 1: stepwise-core
**Location**: `core/`
**Components**:
- 11 skills (research-codebase, create-plan, iterate-plan, implement-plan, validate-plan, thoughts-management, bugmagnet, grill-me, tdd, hamburger-method, small-safe-steps, story-splitting, test-desiderata)
- 5 specialized agents (codebase-locator, codebase-analyzer, codebase-pattern-finder, thoughts-locator, thoughts-analyzer)

### Plugin 2: stepwise-git
**Location**: `git/`
**Components**:
- 2 skills (commit, review-pr-comments)

### Plugin 3: stepwise-web
**Location**: `web/`
**Components**:
- 1 specialized agent (web-search-researcher)

### Plugin 4: stepwise-research
**Location**: `research/`
**Components**:
- 1 skill (deep-research, includes generate-report script)
- 3 specialized agents (research-lead, research-worker, citation-analyst)

### Plugin 5: stepwise-slides
**Location**: `slides/plugins/frontend-slides/` (vendored from `zarazhangrui/frontend-slides`, MIT)
**Components**:
- 1 skill (frontend-slides) with a large template pack

### Plugin 6: stepwise-diagrams
**Location**: `diagrams/` (vendored from `cathrynlavery/diagram-design`, MIT)
**Components**:
- 1 skill (diagram-design) with 38+ editorial diagram types (architecture, flowchart, sequence, ER, sankey, etc.) as self-contained HTML/SVG

## Installation & Testing Workflow

### Installation
```bash
# Add marketplace and install plugins
claude plugin marketplace add git@github.com:nikeyes/stepwise-dev.git
claude plugin install stepwise-core@stepwise-dev
claude plugin install stepwise-git@stepwise-dev
claude plugin install stepwise-web@stepwise-dev
claude plugin install stepwise-research@stepwise-dev
claude plugin install stepwise-slides@stepwise-dev
claude plugin install stepwise-diagrams@stepwise-dev
# Restart Claude Code

# That's it! All components are included in the respective plugins
# No additional installation steps required
```

### Testing Changes

This project has **two types of testing**:

#### 1. Automated Smoke Tests (for bash scripts)

Run automated tests for core bash functionality:

```bash
# Quick smoke test (~2-3 seconds)
make test

# Verbose output with debug info
make test-verbose

# Shellcheck on all bash scripts
make check
```

**What's covered:**
- `core/skills/thoughts-management/scripts/thoughts-init` - Directory creation, README generation
- `core/skills/thoughts-management/scripts/thoughts-metadata` - Metadata generation

**Test files:**
- `test/smoke-test.sh` - Main integration tests
- `test/test-helpers.sh` - Assertion functions and utilities
- `Makefile` - Test runner targets

#### 2. Manual Testing (for skills/agents)

Skills and agents require manual validation in Claude Code:

1. **Test skills in Claude Code:**
   - Skills are loaded via the plugins
   - After modifying a skill file, restart Claude Code or use `/reload-plugins`
   - Test by invoking: `/stepwise-core:research-codebase`, `/stepwise-git:commit`, etc.

2. **Validate agents:**
   - Agents spawn as sub-tasks when skills execute
   - Test by running skills that use them (e.g., `/stepwise-core:research-codebase` spawns `codebase-locator`)
   - Check agent behavior in Claude Code's task output

3. **Test the thoughts-management Skill:**
   - The Skill activates automatically when Claude needs to manage thoughts/
   - Test by creating research documents or plans with stepwise-core
   - Verify Claude calls the Skill to gather metadata

### Iterative Development Cycle

When modifying **skills/agents**:
1. **Edit** the file in `core/skills/`, `core/agents/`, `git/skills/`, `web/agents/`, `research/skills/`, etc.
2. **Test locally** via plugin development mode or by reinstalling the specific plugin
3. **Validate** in a sample project
4. **Iterate** based on results

When modifying **scripts in a Skill**:
1. **Edit** the file in the skill's `scripts/` directory
2. **Reinstall** the plugin or test in development mode
3. **Test** by triggering the Skill
4. **Iterate** based on results

## Architecture

### Skill Structure
Skills are directories with a `SKILL.md` entrypoint:
- Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `model`, `disable-model-invocation`, `allowed-tools`, `argument-hint`
- Instructions for Claude Code on how to behave
- Workflow steps (spawn agents, read files, generate documents)
- Optional supporting files (scripts, templates, references)

### Agent Structure
Agents are specialized markdown files with:
- Frontmatter: `name`, `description`, `tools`, `model`, `color`
- Narrowly-scoped instructions (locate, analyze, or find patterns)
- Called via `Task` tool by skills

### Thoughts System & Skill
The `thoughts-management` Skill provides directory initialization and metadata generation:
```
thoughts/
├── {username}/        # Personal notes (default: nikey_es)
│   ├── tickets/
│   └── notes/
└── shared/            # Team-shared documents
    ├── research/      # Research documents
    ├── plans/         # Implementation plans
    └── prs/           # PR descriptions
```

Use `grep -r thoughts/` to search across all documents.

### Workflow Philosophy

1. **Context management:** Never exceed 60% context
2. **Phased work:** Research → Plan → Implement → Validate
3. **Clear between phases:** Use `/clear` to reset context
4. **Parallel research:** Skills spawn multiple agents concurrently
5. **Local persistence:** All documents saved to `thoughts/` for future reference

## Configuration

**Username**: Set `export THOUGHTS_USER=your_name` (default: `nikey_es`)

### Version Management

**Plugin versions:**
- Managed by Claude Code plugin system
- Check with `claude plugin list`
- Update marketplace and individual plugins:
  - `claude plugin marketplace update stepwise-dev`
  - `claude plugin update stepwise-core@stepwise-dev`
  - `claude plugin update stepwise-git@stepwise-dev`
  - `claude plugin update stepwise-web@stepwise-dev`
  - `claude plugin update stepwise-research@stepwise-dev`

**Scripts:**
- Updated automatically when plugin updates
- Part of the plugin package, no separate installation

## Development Workflow

For **scripts**:
1. Edit file in the skill's `scripts/` directory
2. Test using `make test` (runs automated tests)
3. Test manually by triggering the Skill in Claude Code
4. Iterate based on results

For **skills/agents**:
1. Edit file in the specific plugin directory (`core/skills/`, `git/skills/`, `web/agents/`, `research/skills/`, etc.)
2. Test via plugin reload or development mode
3. Validate in Claude Code
4. Iterate

## Codex compatibility

The same `skills/` directories serve both Claude Code and Codex. The only generated
artifacts are the nine agent `.toml` files.

```
codex/
├── agents/*.toml          # GENERATED — do not edit by hand
├── transpile-agents.sh    # core|research|web/agents/*.md -> codex/agents/*.toml
├── install.sh             # symlinks skills + copies agents
└── uninstall.sh           # removes only what install.sh created
```

### Install

```bash
make install-codex
```

Skills are symlinked into `~/.agents/skills/` (Codex follows symlinks when scanning)
and agents are copied into `~/.codex/agents/`.

### Conventions

- **`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$HOME/.agents}`** — script paths in SKILL.md use this shell
  default so the same line resolves under both harnesses. This *codifies* `$HOME/.agents/skills/`
  as the Codex install location; it is a convention, not a detection, and `install.sh`
  must keep honoring it.
- **`agents/openai.yaml`** in a skill mirrors its `disable-model-invocation` for Codex:
  `true` becomes `allow_implicit_invocation: false`, and `false` becomes `true`.
  The test suite derives the list of skills needing one from the frontmatter, so a
  skill that declares the key without a matching `openai.yaml` fails `make test`.
- **`model: inherit`** transpiles to *no* `model` key in the TOML: a Codex agent without
  one runs on the session's configured model, which is what `inherit` means. The
  `haiku`/`sonnet`/`opus` mappings remain for an agent that deliberately pins a model.
- Agents are regenerated with `make transpile-codex`. `make check-codex` (wired into
  `make ci`) fails if a `.md` changed without regenerating, if a TOML is malformed, or
  if a bare `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` appears without its `:-` default.

### Known limitations

`research-codebase`, `create-plan` and `iterate-plan` use `$ARGUMENTS`, which Codex does
not expand — under Codex, pass the input in the message itself.

`model: inherit` in a SKILL.md frontmatter makes Codex log `ignoring invalid skill
model annotation`, once per skill that declares it. Only the annotation is dropped,
never the skill: it loads and runs on the session's model, which is what `inherit`
asks for anyway. The key stays because Claude Code needs it.


## Vendored plugins

`stepwise-slides` is imported verbatim from
[`zarazhangrui/frontend-slides`](https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides)
(MIT, author Zara Zhang) under the `slides/` prefix via `git subtree`. Upstream
attribution is preserved via `slides/LICENSE`.

Do **not** edit files under `slides/`. Every future `git subtree pull` must
succeed without conflicts; if divergence is needed, wrap the upstream skill
externally instead of patching in place.

Optional sync one-liner (run manually, on demand):

```bash
git subtree pull \
  --prefix=slides \
  https://github.com/zarazhangrui/frontend-slides.git \
  main --squash
```

If the pull brings meaningful changes, patch-bump `stepwise-slides` in both
`plugin.json`-mirroring entries per `.claude/rules/versioning.md`.

`stepwise-diagrams` is imported verbatim from
[`cathrynlavery/diagram-design`](https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design)
(MIT, author Cathryn Lavery) under the `diagrams/` prefix via `git subtree`.
Upstream attribution is preserved via `diagrams/LICENSE`.

Do **not** edit files under `diagrams/`. Same rule as above: every future
`git subtree pull` must succeed without conflicts.

Optional sync one-liner (run manually, on demand):

```bash
git subtree pull \
  --prefix=diagrams \
  https://github.com/cathrynlavery/diagram-design.git \
  main --squash
```

If the pull brings meaningful changes, patch-bump `stepwise-diagrams` in
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` and the top-level marketplace `version` per
`.claude/rules/versioning.md`.
