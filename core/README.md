# 1. Research
/stepwise-core:research-codebase How does authentication work?

# 2. Plan
/stepwise-core:create-plan Add OAuth support

# 3. Implement

## Philosophy

- Keep context < 60% (attention threshold)
- Split work into phases
- Clear between phases, save to thoughts/
- Never lose research or decisions
