# Implement Plan

You are tasked with implementing an approved technical plan from `thoughts/shared/plans/`. These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.

## Getting Started

When given a plan path:
- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])
- Read the original ticket if referenced
- Create a todo list to track your progress (one item per phase)
- Then follow the Phase Cycle below for each phase

**Do NOT read source or test files mentioned in the plan.** The delegated skills will read them. Your role is orchestrator: you understand the plan's structure and delegate execution. If you read the implementation files, you will be tempted to implement directly — that defeats the purpose of this skill.

If no plan path provided, ask for one.

## Your Role: Orchestrator

Your job is to coordinate, not to implement on your own initiative:
- Understand what each phase needs to accomplish
- Delegate implementation to `/stepwise-core:tdd` — let it decide what to write and when
- Delegate quality checks to `/stepwise-core:bugmagnet` and `/stepwise-core:test-desiderata`
- Run verification commands and update progress

You may edit files when a delegated skill instructs you to. What you must not do is decide on your own to write code, add tests, or modify source files.

If a delegated skill reports a structural mismatch (file doesn't exist, architecture changed), STOP and ask the user:
```
Issue in Phase [N]:
Expected: [what the plan says]
Found: [actual situation]
Why this matters: [explanation]

How should I proceed?
```

## Phase Cycle

For **each phase** in the plan, follow this cycle in order:

### Step 1 — Delegate to TDD skill

Invoke `/stepwise-core:tdd` using the `Skill` tool. Pass it:
- The phase description (copy the relevant section from the plan)
- The file paths that need to be created or modified
- The success criteria for this phase

Example argument: "Implement Phase 2 from the plan: Add TodoUpdate model to models.py. Files: src/todo_api/models.py, tests/test_models.py. Success: make test passes."

TDD will read the files, write failing tests, implement, and refactor. Wait for it to complete before proceeding to Step 2.

### Step 2 — Delegate to BugMagnet skill

**Do not analyze bugs yourself.** Invoke `/stepwise-core:bugmagnet` using the `Skill` tool on each file modified in this phase. Wait for it to complete before presenting results to the user.

After bugmagnet completes, **pause and ask the user**:
```
BugMagnet results for Phase [N]:

[List findings from bugmagnet]

Which of these would you like me to implement?
(Reply with your selection, or "none" to skip — then say "continue" when ready to move to test quality analysis.)
```

Wait for the user to say "continue" before proceeding to Step 3.

### Step 3 — Delegate to Test Desiderata skill

**Do not analyze test quality yourself.** Invoke `/stepwise-core:test-desiderata` using the `Skill` tool on the test files for this phase. Wait for it to complete before presenting results to the user.

After test-desiderata completes, **pause and ask the user**:
```
Test Desiderata results for Phase [N]:

[List improvement suggestions]

Which of these would you like me to apply?
```

Wait for the user's selection before proceeding.

### Step 4 — Verify and Advance

- Run all automated success criteria checks (usually `make check test` covers everything)
- Fix any issues before proceeding
- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos
- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit

**Pause for manual verification ONLY if the plan has a "Manual Verification" section:**
- If no manual verification → Continue to next phase immediately
- If manual verification exists → Pause and inform the human:
  ```
  Phase [N] Complete - Ready for Manual Verification

  Automated verification passed:
  - [List automated checks that passed]

  Please perform manual verification:
  - [List manual verification items from the plan]

  Let me know when complete so I can proceed to Phase [N+1].
  ```

**If instructed to execute multiple phases consecutively**: skip only the Step 4 manual verification pauses. Always keep the Step 2 (bugmagnet) and Step 3 (test-desiderata) pauses. Those require user decisions that shape the implementation.

Do not check off manual verification items until the user confirms completion.


## If You Get Stuck

When a delegated skill fails or reports issues:
- Present the problem to the user with context from the skill's output
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written
- Ask for guidance before retrying

Do not attempt to fix issues by reading source files and implementing directly — re-invoke the skill with adjusted instructions.

## Resuming Work

If the plan has existing checkmarks:
- Trust that completed work is done
- Pick up from the first unchecked item
- Verify previous work only if something seems off

Remember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.

## Completion

When all phases are complete:
1. **Run final verification**:
   ```bash
   make check test  # Or project-specific command
   ```

2. **Update the plan file**:
   - Ensure all checkboxes are marked
   - Note any deviations from the original plan

3. **Inform the user**:
   ```
   Implementation complete for: [Plan Name]

   All phases implemented and verified:
   - [List key accomplishments]

   Next steps in the workflow:
   - Use `/stepwise-core:validate-plan thoughts/shared/plans/[filename].md` to verify completeness
   - Use `/stepwise-git:commit` to create git commits for the changes

   Tip: Use `/clear` to free up context before validation
   ```
