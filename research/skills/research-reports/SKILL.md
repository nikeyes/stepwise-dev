# Research Reports Skill

This skill provides utilities for formatting and managing research reports generated by the stepwise-research plugin.

## When to Use This Skill

Claude Code will automatically invoke this skill when:
- A research report needs standardized formatting
- YAML frontmatter needs to be generated for a report
- Bibliography formatting needs to be standardized
- Metadata needs to be extracted from research findings

## Available Scripts

### generate-report

**Purpose:** Generate a properly formatted research report with YAML frontmatter, citations, and structured sections.

**Usage:**
```bash
research/skills/research-reports/scripts/generate-report \
  --title "Research on [Topic]" \
  --query "Original research question" \
  --keywords "keyword1,keyword2,keyword3" \
  --agent-count N \
  --source-count M \
  --output-file "thoughts/shared/research/filename.md" \
  --executive-summary "Summary text" \
  --findings "Findings text with citations" \
  --conclusions "Conclusion text" \
  --bibliography "Bibliography entries"
```

**Parameters:**
- `--title` (required): Report title
- `--query` (required): Original research question
- `--keywords` (required): Comma-separated keywords
- `--agent-count` (required): Number of research agents spawned
- `--source-count` (required): Total unique sources cited
- `--output-file` (required): Output path (should be in thoughts/shared/research/)
- `--executive-summary` (optional): Executive summary section content
- `--findings` (optional): Detailed findings section content
- `--conclusions` (optional): Conclusions section content
- `--bibliography` (optional): Bibliography entries (numbered list)

**Output:**
Generates a markdown file with this structure:
```markdown
---
title: [Title]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
query: [Query]
keywords: [keywords]
status: complete
agent_count: N
source_count: M
---

# [Title]

## Executive Summary
[Content]

## Detailed Findings
[Content with citations]

## Conclusions
[Content]

## Bibliography
[Numbered citations]

---
*Research conducted by stepwise-research multi-agent system*
*Generated: [timestamp]*
```

## Report Structure Standards

### YAML Frontmatter Fields
- `title`: Human-readable report title
- `date`: ISO 8601 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `query`: Original research question (verbatim)
- `keywords`: 5-8 extracted key terms
- `status`: `complete` | `draft` | `in-progress`
- `agent_count`: Number of research agents used
- `source_count`: Total unique sources cited

### Required Sections
1. **Executive Summary**: 3-5 sentence overview answering the research question
2. **Detailed Findings**: Organized by theme/topic with subsections
3. **Conclusions**: 3-5 bullet points summarizing key takeaways
4. **Bibliography**: Numbered list with format: `[N] Source Title - URL`

### Optional Sections
- **Cross-References and Contradictions**: Areas of consensus/disagreement
- **Methodology**: How research was conducted (if relevant)
- **Limitations**: Gaps or constraints in the research

## Citation Format

Citations must follow this format:

**In-text:**
```markdown
Docker uses containerd as its default runtime [1] [2].
```

**Bibliography:**
```markdown
[1] Docker Documentation - https://docs.docker.com/engine/
[2] Containerd Official Site - https://containerd.io/
```

## Integration with Thoughts System

Reports are saved to:
```
thoughts/shared/research/[sanitized-topic]-[YYYY-MM-DD].md
```

Filename sanitization rules:
- Convert to lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove special characters (keep only alphanumeric and hyphens)
- Truncate to 60 characters max
- Append date suffix

Example:
- Query: "What is Kubernetes and how does it work?"
- Filename: `what-is-kubernetes-and-how-does-it-work-2026-02-19.md`

After report creation, the `thoughts-management` Skill will automatically sync hardlinks to `thoughts/searchable/`.

## Script Implementation Notes

The `generate-report` script:
- Validates all required parameters
- Generates properly formatted YAML frontmatter
- Ensures consistent section ordering
- Adds generation metadata footer
- Creates parent directories if needed
- Returns success/failure status

## Error Handling

If report generation fails:
- Check that `thoughts/shared/research/` directory exists
- Verify all required parameters are provided
- Check for write permissions
- Validate YAML frontmatter syntax

## Future Enhancements

Potential future additions to this skill:
- `validate-report`: Check report structure and citation format
- `export-report`: Convert to PDF, HTML, or other formats
- `merge-reports`: Combine multiple research reports
- `extract-citations`: Pull bibliography from existing reports
